# Calculator App Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Calculator app, tied to the existing tests in `test_calculator.py`. We'll implement these features step by step using Aider.

## 1. Multiplication
- Implement a `multiply` method in the `Calculator` class.
- The method should take two numbers as input and return their product.
- Corresponding test: `test_multiplication`

## 2. Division
- Implement a `divide` method in the `Calculator` class.
- The method should take two numbers as input and return their quotient.
- Handle division by zero by raising a `ValueError`.
- Corresponding test: `test_division`

## 3. Square Root
- Implement a `square_root` method in the `Calculator` class.
- The method should take a number as input and return its square root.
- Handle negative inputs by raising a `ValueError`.
- Corresponding test: `test_square_root`

## 4. Percentage Calculation
- Implement a `percentage` method in the `Calculator` class.
- The method should take two numbers as input: the percentage and the total value.
- It should return the calculated percentage of the total value.
- Corresponding test: `test_percentage`

## 5. Update Main Function
- Update the `main` function to include options for the new operations:
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Square Root
  - Percentage Calculation
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.

## 6. Update README
- Update the README.md file to include information about the new features.

As we implement each feature, we'll use Aider to make the necessary changes to the `calculator.py` file and update the `main` function to include the new operations.

## 7. Running Tests
- Install the required package for colored output:
  ```
  pip install termcolor
  ```
- Run the tests using the new `run_tests.py` script:
  ```
  python run_tests.py
  ```
- This will provide a visually appealing, colored output of all test results.
